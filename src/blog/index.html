            <h3>April 2nd: Starting My 3D Website Journey</h3>
            <p>
              Hey everyone! Today, I decided to start a new project. I've always
              been fascinated by 3D graphics and web development, so I thought,
              why not combine the two? I began working on an interactive 3D
              scene using Three.js and SCSS. I spent the day setting up the
              basic structure and importing the necessary libraries and fonts.
            </p>

            <h3>April 3rd: Diving Deeper into Three.js</h3>
            <p>
              Today was all about diving deeper into Three.js. I set up a canvas
              and started working on adding some 3D models to my scene. I
              encountered a few challenges with positioning the models correctly
              and adjusting the scale, but I managed to make some progress.
            </p>
          </li>

            <h3>April 5th: First Batch of 3D Models</h3>
            <p>
              I made some good progress today! I added the first batch of 3D
              models to my scene, including a Michelangelo statue and a woman
              model. I used the GLTFLoader in Three.js to import the models and
              spent some time adjusting their positions and scales.
            </p>
          </li>

            <h3>April 8th: Fixing Positioning Issues</h3>
            <p>
              I realized that the positioning of my 3D models was off on smaller
              screens. After some debugging, I managed to fix the positioning
              issues and made sure the models looked good on all screen sizes.
            </p>
          </li>

            <h3>April 9th: Adding More Models</h3>
            <p>
              Today, I added a few more 3D models to my scene, including an
              angel, Lacoon, and the Thinker. I spent some time adjusting the
              positions and scales to make sure everything looked balanced.

            <h3>April 10th: Styling and Layout Improvements</h3>
            <p>
              I spent today working on styling and layout improvements. I added
              some hover effects and transitions to make the website more
              interactive and engaging. I also worked on optimizing the code for
              better performance.
            </p>

            <h3>April 11th: Cleaning Up the Code</h3>
            <p>
              I spent today cleaning up the code and organizing everything for
              better maintainability. I consolidated the font declarations and
              organized the CSS rules to make the code more organized and easier
              to understand.
            </p>

            <h3>April 12th: Refactoring JavaScript Code</h3>
            <p>
              I decided to refactor the JavaScript code to make it more
              organized and modular. I added comments and organized the code
              into separate functions to make it easier to manage.
            </p>

            <h3>April 13th: Introducing GSAP for Animations</h3>
            <p>
              Today's update involved implementing the GSAP (GreenSock Animation
              Platform) library. GSAP allows for smooth and performant
              animations, which I'll be using to create eye-catching
              transitions, interactive elements, and better guide users through
              the content. Stay tuned to see how GSAP animations elevate the
              user experience!

            <h3>
              April 15th: Enhancing User Engagement with Interactive Overlays
            </h3>
            <p>
              Today's focus was on refining the user experience by implementing
              interactive overlays. These overlays, triggered by hovering over
              designated website sections, provide additional information and
              visual interest. This subtle animation technique aims to increase
              user engagement and encourage exploration of different content
              areas. To achieve these animations, I utilized the GSAP animation
              library for its smooth transitions and customizable easing
              effects. Additionally, I prioritized code efficiency by employing
              reusable functions and targeted event listeners, ensuring optimal
              website performance. While seemingly minor, these final touches
              contribute significantly to a more engaging and enjoyable user
              experience.

              He guides us with patience, building a home<br />
              For code to reside, both front-end and back,<br />
              A system well-balanced, on the right track.<br />
              <br />
              But Vue takes the spotlight, a framework so grand,<br />
              He unlocks its secrets, with a helping hand.<br />
              <br />
              Components and data, directives in flight,<br />
              Building dynamic apps, a coding delight.<br />
              <br />
              His lectures, they weave with a passion so bright,<br />
              Making the complex seem clear and just right.<br />
              <br />
              So here's to Professor Bart, may his lessons inspire,<br />
              In web's vast domain, setting our minds on fire.<br />
              <br />
