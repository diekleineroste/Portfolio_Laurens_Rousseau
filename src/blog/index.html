            <h3>April 2nd: Starting My 3D Website Journey</h3>
            <p>
              Hey everyone! Today, I decided to start a new project. I've always
              been fascinated by 3D graphics and web development, so I thought,
              why not combine the two? I began working on an interactive 3D
              scene using Three.js and SCSS. I spent the day setting up the
              basic structure and importing the necessary libraries and fonts.
            </p>

            <h3>April 3rd: Diving Deeper into Three.js</h3>
            <p>
              Today was all about diving deeper into Three.js. I set up a canvas
              and started working on adding some 3D models to my scene. I
              encountered a few challenges with positioning the models correctly
              and adjusting the scale, but I managed to make some progress.
            </p>
          </li>

            <h3>April 5th: First Batch of 3D Models</h3>
            <p>
              I made some good progress today! I added the first batch of 3D
              models to my scene, including a Michelangelo statue and a woman
              model. I used the GLTFLoader in Three.js to import the models and
              spent some time adjusting their positions and scales.
            </p>
          </li>

            <h3>April 8th: Fixing Positioning Issues</h3>
            <p>
              I realized that the positioning of my 3D models was off on smaller
              screens. After some debugging, I managed to fix the positioning
              issues and made sure the models looked good on all screen sizes.
            </p>

            <h3>April 9th: Adding More Models</h3>
            <p>
              Today, I added a few more 3D models to my scene, including an
              angel, Lacoon, and the Thinker. I spent some time adjusting the
              positions and scales to make sure everything looked balanced.

            <h3>April 10th: Styling and Layout Improvements</h3>
            <p>
              I spent today working on styling and layout improvements. I added
              some hover effects and transitions to make the website more
              interactive and engaging. I also worked on optimizing the code for
              better performance.
            </p>

            <h3>April 11th: Cleaning Up the Code</h3>
            <p>
              I spent today cleaning up the code and organizing everything for
              better maintainability. I consolidated the font declarations and
              organized the CSS rules to make the code more organized and easier
              to understand.
            </p>

            <h3>April 12th: Refactoring JavaScript Code</h3>
            <p>
              I decided to refactor the JavaScript code to make it more
              organized and modular. I added comments and organized the code
              into separate functions to make it easier to manage.
            </p>

            <h3>April 13th: Introducing GSAP for Animations</h3>
            <p>
              Today's update involved implementing the GSAP (GreenSock Animation
              Platform) library. GSAP allows for smooth and performant
              animations, which I'll be using to create eye-catching
              transitions, interactive elements, and better guide users through
              the content. Stay tuned to see how GSAP animations elevate the
              user experience!

            <h3>April 14th: Modifying the RSS Feed with a Plugin</h3>
            <p>
              Today's focus was on the website's RSS feed. I incorporated a
              plugin to enhance its functionality. This plugin allows for
              customization of the feed's appearance, content management, and
              improved readability. These changes aim to make the RSS feed a
              more valuable tool for users to stay informed about new content.
