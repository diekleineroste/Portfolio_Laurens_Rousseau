            <title>April 8th: Fixing Positioning Issues</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <description>I realized that the positioning of my 3D models was off on smaller screens. After some debugging, I managed to fix the positioning issues and made sure the models looked good on all screen sizes.</description>

            <title>April 5th: First Batch of 3D Models</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <description>I made some good progress today! I added the first batch of 3D models to my scene, including a Michelangelo statue and a woman model. I used the GLTFLoader in Three.js to import the models and spent some time adjusting their positions and scales.</description>

            <description>Today was all about diving deeper into Three.js. I set up a canvas and started working on adding some 3D models to my scene. I encountered a few challenges with positioning the models correctly and adjusting the scale, but I managed to make some progress.</description>

            <title>April 2nd: Starting My 3D Website Journey</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <description>Hey everyone! Today, I decided to start a new project. I've always been fascinated by 3D graphics and web development, so I thought, why not combine the two? I began working on an interactive 3D scene using Three.js and SCSS. I spent the day setting up the basic structure and importing the necessary libraries and fonts.</description>
